#Calculator

This is a simple calculator, which uses the Shunting Yard Algorithm to convert an infix expression into Reverse Polish Notation. From there the expression is evaluated.

Operations currently supported:
* Addition ("*")
* Subtraction ("-")
* Multiplication ("*")
* Division ("/")
* Parenthesis are also supported 

Expressions must be entered with each operand/operator separated by a space, e.g:

"1 + 2 / 5 * ( 10 + 1 )"

Results are returned unrounded.
